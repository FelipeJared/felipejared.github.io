ERNIE is a robotic rover I designed and programmed together with the team I co-founded: CRATER (Caltech Rover Autonomy, Technology, and Exploration Research). We participated in the International Rover Challenge, where we had to remotely control ERNIE to complete tasks such as pipe repairs, material transportation, and night traversal.
