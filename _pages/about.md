Hi! I'm a senior Computer Science B.S. student at Western Governors University.

I have work experience on Flight Software, Simulation, and Machine Learning projects for space satellites, as well as research projects focusing on Vision and Large Language Models.

I also enjoy working on robotics projects, and for my latest one I developed software for ERNIE, a robotic rover. I worked on ERNIE with the Caltech Rover Autonomy, Technology, and Exploration Research (CRATER) team, which I co-founded with friends I made at one of my internships.
